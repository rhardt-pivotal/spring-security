/**
 * Provides core user information.

 * Implementations are not used directly by Spring Security for security purposes. They
 * simply store user information which is later encapsulated into {@link Authentication}
 * objects. This allows non-security related user information (such as email addresses,
 * telephone numbers etc) to be stored in a convenient location.
 * <p>
 * Concrete implementations must take particular care to ensure the non-null contract
 * detailed for each method is enforced. See
 * {@link User} for a reference
 * implementation (which you might like to extend or use in your code).
